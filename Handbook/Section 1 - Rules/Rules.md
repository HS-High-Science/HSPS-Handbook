# HSPS Rules

## Rule 1: No HSPS Leaks.
- All HSPS operational activities and communications are subject to strict classification measures. This encompasses all communication transmitted within the HSPS Discord, exchanges within the Security team chat in-game, conversations held in HSPS voice channels, and any information about trainings or other security events.

## Rule 2: Follow ALL Orders.
- Example: If a Senior Guard requests help from an Officer in protecting the FFD, the OFC should diligently reply to the request.
However, following orders from people in higher-ranking categories is mandatory for all HSPS guards.
Should a member consider that an order violates any HSPS rules/guidelines or is otherwise fallacious, compliance with the order remains required. However, it's **strongly urged** to accumulate proof and report the issue to a Junior Instructor or above. Following a bad order **will _not_** result in disciplinary movement.
Furthermore, refrain from mini-modding other guards. Deliberately scrutinizing the actions of others, assuming an HR function, and then reporting them to HR is **frowned upon**.

## Rule 3: Use full grammar.
In public in-game chat, adherence to proper grammar is REQUIRED at all times. The requirement for full grammar usage is exempted in the Discord channels and the in-game team chat. For a comprehensive understanding of punctuation rules, refer to [this](https://cdn.astrohweston.xyz/u/l1naJC.jpg) resource for a quick reminder.

## Rule 4: Act Professional.
- HSPS must show a high professionalism while on-duty. This means you are not allowed to: make unnecessary comments outside of team chat or dance in the public area or make any unnecessary jokes (outside of security zones w/o windows; in security chat is allowed) 
- Under no circumstances Security Guards are not allowed to act toxic against any player/chaos/employees/staff (Telling: "ez", "L", "bozo", etc. or humping the corpses). As that is seen as unprofessional and gives a bad look on the security team. As toxicity will not be tolerated.
- You as security are representing not just yourself, but other security members, It is required that you are to remain and act professional in even the most "heated" circumstances. A bit of fun is okay as it is part of the game, However do not get too carried away.

## Rule 5: Don't go inactive.
- Regardless of the existence of a specified quota, a certain level of activity within the group is anticipated by all members. While self-care takes precedence, it is essential to maintain a level of engagement. After all, it was your choice to join HSPS. In instances where a quota is defined, following it is mandatory. Failure to meet this quota on multiple occasions may result in disciplinary measures such as strikes, suspension, or removal from HSPS.

## Rule 6: Do not be disrespectful
- HSPS operates under a structured hierarchy of ranks; however, a personâ€™s rank does not warrant disrespect towards fellow members. Instructors are expected to afford the same level of respect to a Recruit as a recruit would to them. **Every member is obligated to treat others with respect, regardless of their rank**.
  This principle extends beyond internal HSPS interactions. Any form of aggression or disrespect towards individuals, groups, or any sort of entity, whether within or outside of HSPS, will not be condoned. Let us cultivate a culture of mutual respect to uphold the integrity of our community.

## Rule 7: Do not bend the rules.
- We are aware that certain individuals may attempt to exploit loopholes or ambiguities in the rules in an attempt to circumvent regulations. Such behavior will not be condoned. Swift and severe consequences will be administered to those found attempting to manipulate the rules for personal gain.
- Do not try to find loopholes within the rules, the rules are there for a reason. Using any loopholes to prevent/avoid/work your way around the existing rules is seen as trying to bend the rules.
- Maliciously trying to attempt to find loopholes within the rules will result in a harsher punishment.
- This is not to be mistaken for misunderstanding the rules or having genuine intentions of the rules where you believed you understood them. We will know if it's intentional or not.
**Consider this your _only_ warning.**

## HSPS Rules

### Rule 1: No Leaks
- All HSPS activities and communications are subject to strict classification measures. This encompasses all communication transmitted within the HSPS Discord, exchanges within team chat in-game, conversations held in HSPS voice channels, and any information about security events.

### Rule 2: Follow the Chain of Command
- It is required that all Security Personnel obey orders from those who are ranked higher than them in the Chain of Command. It should be noted that an order is different from a request. For example, if a Guardsman requests help from an Officer in protecting the FFD, then the Officer should diligently respond to the request. Should a guard believe that an order given violates an HS/HSPS rule, or is otherwise wrongful, the order must still be obeyed. Still, it's 
**strongly urged** to gather proof and report the order to a member of Pre-Command or above. Following an order that violates a rule will **will _not_** result in disciplinary action against those who follow it. This is to prevent you from being punished for insubordination. Furthermore, refrain from mini-modding other guards. Deliberately scrutinizing the actions of others, assuming an HR function, or acting as if you have authority you do not have is **frowned upon**. Additionally, you should not be mini-modding/assuming a moderator function when you are not one. An example of this would be telling CF to use team-chat.

### Rule 3: Use Grammar.
In public chat, while in-game, adherence to proper grammar is REQUIRED at all times while on duty. The requirement for full grammar usage is exempted in Discord channels and while speaking in team chat. 

### Rule 4: Act Professional
Members of HSPS must show a high level of professionalism while on-duty. This means you are not allowed to: 
- Make unnecessary comments outside of team chat
- Dance in public areas 
- Show any immaturity in public areas
- When off duty , you must maintain the professional standards that been set, to keep an example. This means, you don't have to use grammar, just don't be stupid.

Under no circumstances are Security Guards allowed to act toxic towards any other Employee, Staff Member, or Chaos Forces Member (Saying: "ez", "L", "bozo", etc. or humping corpses). This behavior is seen as unprofessional and gives HSPS a bad look. This kind of toxicity will not be tolerated and will be met with strict consequences.

You as a member of HSPS are representing not just yourself but HSPS as a whole. It is required that you remain and act professional in even the most heated circumstances. A bit of fun is okay as it is part of the game, however do not get carried away.


### Rule 5: Be Active
- Regardless of the existence of a quota, activity within HSPS is expected for all members of HSPS. While real life matters take priority, it is essential to maintain a level of activity. After all, it was your choice to join HSPS, being aware of whatever circumstances you were in. While the bare minimum is the quota, it is encouraged to exceed the quota. Failure to meet the quota on multiple occasions may result in disciplinary measures such as strikes, suspensions, or termination.


### Rule 6: No Disrespect
- HSPS operates under a structured hierarchy of ranks. However, a person’s rank does not warrant disrespect towards fellow members. Instructors are expected to give the same level of respect to a Recruit as a Recruit would to them. **Every member is obligated to treat others with respect, regardless of their rank**. This principle extends beyond internal HSPS interactions. Any form of aggression or disrespect towards other individuals, or groups of people, whether in or outside of HSPS, will not be tolerated. Mutual respect and being the better person is expected out of every member of HSPS.

### Rule 7: No Loopholes/Bending the Rules
- We are aware that certain individuals may attempt to exploit loopholes or “gray areas” in the rules, in an attempt to circumvent regulation. Such behavior will not be condoned. Swift and severe consequences will be administered to those found attempting to manipulate the rules for their own personal gain.
Rules against loopholes are often ridiculed, but it is a different way of saying “Don’t abuse mistakes made when the guidelines were written.”. An example of this is if it was written that KoS is allowed if the core is above 80.000K. Obviously they meant 80,000K, not 80, and you should not abuse the fact they used a period instead of a comma. Instead, you should report this mistake, so that those who are not as mature as yourself cannot abuse the rule.
Maliciously trying to attempt to find loopholes within the rules will result in disciplinary action. 
This is not to be mistaken for misunderstanding the rules. It is blatantly obvious if a misunderstanding is international or not.

### Rule 8: Only go on duty on PC.
- You are only permitted to go on duty using a PC (Laptop or Desktop). This is to ensure that we do not encounter any issues that can affect us while patrolling. Mobile devices and consoles have been disallowed due to it having their own limitations, do not go on duties while on either mobile or console.

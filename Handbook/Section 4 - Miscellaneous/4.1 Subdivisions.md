## Subdivisions
As HSPS grew bigger, it was obvious that some guards might have a high level of specialization that should be recognized, thus subdivisions were introduced.

### Subdivision List
#### MRT (Militarized Response Team)
**MRT** is an “elite HS unit whose mission is to protect strategic sites from external and internal threats.” They have the best HSPS guards in their ranks, allowing them to cope with any challenge that comes their way. MRT has rule bypasses to reach the best combat result.

### Joining a Subdivision
In order to join a subdivision must wait for a recruitment event to be hosted by subdivision command, and meet the requirements specified.

### Subdivision Events
There are two types of events that are hosted internally within each subdivision. 

#### Subdivision Trainings
Subdivision supervisors are permitted to create and execute their own trainings. However, there is no HSPS wide point reward for attending subdivision trainings.

#### Subdivision Patrols
Subdivision supervisors are permitted to create and execute their own patrols on CPUF. Everyone attending gets awarded 1 point every 15 minutes on that patrol.
Once the patrol ends, the host of the patrol should gather a list of how many points each person should get, and forward it to a member of Pre-Command, so they can get the points issued.

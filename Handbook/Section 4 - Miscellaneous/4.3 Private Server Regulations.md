## Private Server Regulations

In Private Servers, the following rules within the HSPS Handbook are voided:
- Section 1: Rules 2, 3, and 4
- Section 2: 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3
- Section 3: 3.1 through 3.5
- Section 4: 4.2

Even though these rules are voided, you are still expected to follow the rules put in place by the Private Server Owner that do not interfere with the non-voided rules in this handbook. If they tell you to get off team, get off team. If they tell you to not kill those who enter the FFD, donâ€™t kill them, and so on.

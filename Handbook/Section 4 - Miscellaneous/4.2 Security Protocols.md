## Security Protocols

### White Night
**White Night** can be issued by HSPS members ranking **Guardsman+.**
You can issue White Night when the following requirements are met
1. The employees attempting to destabilize the reactor have gone out of Security control;
2. Temperature is outside safe limits (Above 75,000 or below 20,000 kelvin)

White Night regulations are as follows;
- Notify on-duty security (either in team chat or in voice chat if you have a microphone) that the protocol is active.
- You must inform employees that they are required to leave the RCR or face termination.
  - You need to give them ample time to comply with that order.
- You should inform employees every now and then that the reactor control room is under lockdown to avoid confusion.
- The protocol can be active for a maximum of 15 minutes and **must** be lifted within 2 minutes of ECFR reaching safe temperatures (25,000K to 70,000 K)
- The Coolant Pump Room may also be locked down.
- The employee carrying the e-shutdown key can be whitelisted and let into the control room as long as their intention is not to destabilize the reactor.

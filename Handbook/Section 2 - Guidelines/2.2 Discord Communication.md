## Discord Communications
These regulations will go over rules for HS/HSPS discord servers. These guidelines donâ€™t only apply to text channels, but to voice channels as well. Please have Rule 4 in mind before you have any conversations.

### When On Duty
- You are required to join the On-duty VC(s) as soon as you get on team (or right before you get on team), as it eases communications for those who do decide to talk in VC
  - You are **not** required to use a microphone.
- Should you be heavily outnumbered or outgunned, you are permitted to request backup in the [#backup-request](https://discord.com/channels/1258840960734072914/1258876954497777684) forum. ([See 3.6 Backup Requests](../Section%203%20-%20Operations/3.6%20Backup%20Requests.md))

### When Off Duty
Full grammar does not need to be maintained while off-duty. Feel free to talk to other guards without grammar, but please use common sense.

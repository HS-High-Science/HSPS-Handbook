## Discord Communications
These regulations will go over rules for HS/HSPS discord servers. These guidelines donâ€™t only apply to text channels, but to voice channels as well. Please have Rule 4 in mind before you have any conversations.

### When On Duty
- You are now required to join the On-duty VC(s) as soon as you get on team, as it eases communications for those who do decide to talk in VC
  - You are not required to use a microphone. Simply being in a VC with everyone else is easier for everyone who is using a microphone.
- Should you be heavily outnumbered or outgunned, you are permitted to request backup in the #backup-request channel. (Reference 3.6)
  - When requesting backup, please supply your Roblox profile link so people can join through it, and make sure your joins are enabled for everyone.
  - Other forms of supplying a method of joining the game, like RoPro, are also allowed.

### When Off Duty
Full grammar does not need to be maintained while off-duty. Feel free to talk to other guards without grammar, but please use common sense.

## Activity & Quota
As a member of HSPS, you are expected to be at least somewhat active within HSPS and the HS community. If you need to file an LOA, do so in #leave-of-absence.

### Current Quota
(As of April 8th, 2024)
__In-Game Activity (Shifts)__ - 2 hours (120 mins) per month.
**OR**
__Training Attendance__ - Once a Month.


If you fail to meet the quota, you will be given a quota strike. If you completed your quota, but do not have the “training attendance” role, send proof in #quota-accept.

### Shift Recording
Quota Counter starts/stops automatically when joining or leaving the Security Team. To record it, you need to screenshot the last record of the month from the #security-shift-log or #bot-commands, and send in your #shift-record thread. Remember, you don’t need to create a new thread if you already made one. You only need to submit your shift record at minimum once a month.

### Quota Rules
As this system is new and gives everyone a huge advantage in gaining points, we have instituted strict rules that everyone using the shift logger must follow.

#### Quota Rule 1: Logging Private server shifts and/or AFKing on shift is not allowed
Unless it’s an official HSPS event, you are not permitted to start a shift on a private server. Furthermore, if you need to be AFK for longer than 7 minutes, please end your shift and get off team to deal with your situation.

#### Quota Rule 2: You are allowed to log up to 8 hours of quota per day
We care about your health and don’t support excessive playtime. Take regular breaks and monitor your health while on duty. If you feel ill, we recommend not getting on at all.

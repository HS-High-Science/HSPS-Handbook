# Section 1 - Rules

## HSPS Rules

### Rule 1: No Leaks.
- All HSPS activities and communications are subject to strict classification measures. This encompasses all communication transmitted within the HSPS Discord, exchanges within team chat in-game, conversations held in HSPS voice channels, and any information about security events.

### Rule 2: Follow the Chain of Command.
- It is required that all Security Personnel obey orders from those who are ranked higher than them in the Chain of Command. It should be noted that an order is different from a request. For example, if a Guardsman requests help from an Officer in protecting the FFD, then the Officer should diligently respond to the request. Should a guard believe that an order given violates an HS/HSPS rule, or is otherwise wrongful, the order must still be obeyed. Still, it's 
**strongly urged** to gather proof and report the order to a member of Pre-Command or above. Following an order that violates a rule **will _not_** result in disciplinary action against those who follow it. This is to prevent you from being punished for insubordination. Furthermore, refrain from mini-modding other guards. Deliberately scrutinizing the actions of others, assuming an HR function, or acting as if you have authority you do not have is **frowned upon**. Additionally, you should not be mini-modding/assuming a moderator function when you are not one. An example of this would be telling CF to use team-chat.

### Rule 3: Use Grammar.
- In public chat, while in-game, you must write in proper English at all times while on duty. This includes adherence to proper grammar, capitalization and punctuation. This requirement is exempted in Discord channels and while speaking in team chat or in private messages.

### Rule 4: Act Professional.
Members of HSPS must show a high level of professionalism while on-duty. This means you are not allowed to: 
- Make unnecessary comments outside of team chat
- Talk to members of the Chaos Forces team in the global chat
- Dance in public areas 
- Show any immaturity in public areas
- When off duty, you must maintain the professional standards that been set, to keep an example. This means, you don't have to use grammar, just don't be stupid.

Under no circumstances are Security Guards allowed to act toxic towards any other Employee, Staff Member, or Chaos Forces Member (Saying: "ez", "L", "bozo", etc. or humping corpses). This behavior is seen as unprofessional and gives HSPS a bad look. This kind of toxicity will not be tolerated and will be met with strict consequences.

You as a member of HSPS are representing not just yourself but HSPS as a whole. It is required that you remain and act professional in even the most heated circumstances. A bit of fun is okay as it is part of the game, however do not get carried away.


### Rule 5: Be Active.
- Regardless of the existence of a quota, activity within HSPS is expected for all members of HSPS. While real life matters take priority, it is essential to maintain a level of activity. After all, it was your choice to join HSPS, being aware of whatever circumstances you were in. While the bare minimum is the quota, it is encouraged to exceed the quota. Failure to meet the quota on multiple occasions may result in disciplinary measures such as strikes, suspensions, or termination. You should stay up-to-date with all important announcements regarding HSPS.

### Rule 6: No Disrespect.
- HSPS operates under a structured hierarchy of ranks. However, a person’s rank does not warrant disrespect towards fellow members. Instructors are expected to give the same level of respect to a Cadet as a Cadet would to them. **Every member is obligated to treat others with respect, regardless of their rank**. This principle extends beyond internal HSPS interactions. Any form of aggression or disrespect towards other individuals or groups of people, whether in or outside of HSPS, will not be tolerated. Mutual respect and being the better person is expected out of every member of HSPS. If someone is disrespectful to you, you are encouraged to gather evidence and report them. Starting or keeping up disrespectful arguments is prohibited.

### Rule 7: Use Your Brain.
- Even though the handbook covers a lot of aspects of Security personnel duties, you should still note that there are going to be situations in which you will have to rely on yourself and your experience, think logically and make rational decisions. Before taking action, think twice about what action would resolve the situation in the best way.

### Rule 8: No Loopholes/Bending the Rules.
- We are aware that certain individuals may attempt to exploit loopholes or “gray areas” in the rules, in an attempt to circumvent regulation. Such behavior will not be condoned. Swift and severe consequences will be administered to those found attempting to manipulate the rules for their own personal gain.
Rules against loopholes are often ridiculed, but it is a different way of saying “Don’t abuse mistakes made when the guidelines were written.”. For an example, if the rule says "KoS is allowed if the core is above 80.000K", obviously it means 80 thousand kelvin, not 80 kelvin, and you should not abuse the fact that there's a period instead of a comma. Instead, you should report this mistake, so that those who are not as mature as yourself cannot abuse the rule.
Maliciously attempting to find loopholes within the rules will result in disciplinary action.
This is not to be mistaken for misunderstanding the rules. It is sometimes obvious if a misunderstanding is intentional or not.

### Rule 9: Only go on duty on PC.
- You are only permitted to go on duty using a PC (Laptop or Desktop). This is to ensure that we do not encounter any issues that can affect us while patrolling. Mobile devices and consoles have been disallowed due to them having their own limitations

### Rule 10: Notify the HSPS developers if you are planning to change your Roblox username.
- HSPS and HSPS Manager in particular heavily rely on the database system. Upon registration, your Roblox username is saved in the database. **The username changes are not tracked automatically.** Please notify the HSPS developers of your username change **in advance** to prevent desync and other unwanted behavior.


## HS Rules
It is important to note that HSPS Handbook inherits all of the general High Science rules. Breaching any of those rules (regardless if the breach was commited in the HS server or outside of it) will land you with a punishment in HSPS. Further, getting punished in the main server or in CPUF will also get you additional punishment in HSPS.

# Section 2 - Guidelines

## 2.1 In-game communications
This section of the guidelines will go in-depth about interactions with other players in CPUF. In general, when you are talking, please ensure you abide by all HS and HSPS rules.

### When On Duty
- Your primary communication channel should be team chat. Do not speak in public chat unless it’s absolutely necessary (Ie: Answering a question, Coordinating a shutdown, etc.). Furthermore, **do not** speak to members on the CF team in public chat.
 - Members ranking pre-command and above are given more leniency in regards to speaking in public chat, however all messages should always follow the rules.
- Please double-check that your messages are being sent to the intended place. If you mean to communicate in team chat, ensure your message is being sent there. Mistakes happen, however try avoiding them in the first place.

#### Roblox Voice
Spatial voice is prohibited on-shift for anyone who is not Pre-Command or higher for a multitude of reasons.
- In Spatial Voice, there's no differentiated "team chat", your speech is able to be heard by everyone nearby.
- Numerous players, both guards and employees, may not utilize or have access to Spatial Voice. Consequently, if you employ it, not everyone may have the ability to hear you.
- We have Discord voice channels for a reason, there is no reason to use Spatial Voice.
If you're addressed via Spatial Voice, reply using text chat. If you encounter pressure to use a microphone, treat it as you would any other form of harassment. Pre-Command and above may use Spatial Voice responsibly, but it's strongly advised to not do so for the reasons stated above.

### When Off Duty
When you are not on duty, you are not expected to follow any of the above rules as you are not acting in the official capacity of a guard. Please note that behavior that reflects on HSPS is still punishable under HSPS rules 4 and 6.

## 2.2 Discord Communications
These regulations will go over rules for HS/HSPS discord servers. These guidelines don’t only apply to text channels, but to voice channels as well. Please have Rule 4 in mind before you have any conversations.

### When On Duty
- You are required to join the On-duty VC(s) as soon as you get on team (or right before you get on team), as it eases communications for those who do decide to talk in VC
 - You are **not** required to use a microphone.
- Should you be heavily outnumbered or outgunned, you are permitted to request backup in the [#backup-request](https://discord.com/channels/1258840960734072914/1258876954497777684) forum. ([See 3.6 Backup Requests](./Handbook.md#36-backup-requests))

### When Off Duty
Full grammar does not need to be maintained while off-duty. Feel free to talk to other guards without grammar, but please use common sense.

## 2.3 Ranks
We have many ranks within our department. Below they are described in detail, including how the rank is obtained. The ranks are ordered from lowest to highest in the chain of command. Note that all ranks inherit perks of ranks below them.

## 2.4 Disciplinary Actions
Here at HSPS, we have a disciplinary system that all members of Pre-Command+ stick to. Disciplinary actions are given at the discretion of Officers and Pre-Command+.

### Commendations
Commendations are issued at the discretion of Officers and above when something you did was considered exemplary. Commendations are only issued when such behavior is witnessed and they do not require hard evidence. Commendations get removed three months after they have been issued.

### Reprimands
Reprimands are issued at the discretion of Officers and above when something you did was considered incorrect, negligent, or generally frowned upon. You don’t have to specifically get a reprimand for breaking rules, but rather your general actions. Reprimands get removed three months after they have been issued.

### Strikes
Strikes are issued at the discretion of Junior Instructors and above when something you did breached HSPS or High Science rules. Strikes are the intermediate version of punishments and stick out during promotions.

#### Types of Strikes
As of writing, there are only two types of strikes
- 1: Disciplinary strikes
  - Disciplinary strikes are strikes that are issued regarding behavior or any other sort of HSPS/HS rule breach.
- 2: Quota Strikes
  - Quota strikes are strikes that are issued for not meeting the quota within a quota cycle.

#### Strike System
We follow a strict strike system that applies to all members of HSPS; guards and instructors alike. The strike system is as follows:
1. First strike: No consequences
2. Second strike: Demotion by one rank^
3. Third strike: Demotion by one rank^
4. Fourth strike: Termination

*Punishments may vary depending on the severity of the offense.*

^ = If you can be demoted. For example, if a Junior Guardsman was on their second strike, they would be immediately terminated, as we don’t __demote to cadet.__

#### Getting rid of strikes
We believe everyone should be given a proper chance to show that they have improved after disciplinary action has been taken against them.
There are two ways of getting your strikes removed:
- 1: Objecting to a Strike 
  - If you think a strike that was issued is unfair, you are able to object to it immediately after it has been issued. Strike objections have a limit, meaning, if you don’t submit your objection within seven days of it being issued, you will not be able to object to it.
- 2: Getting a Strike Reviewed
  - If you believe that your behavior has improved since a strike has been issued, you are able to file a strike review at least 4 months (16 weeks) after it was issued. Here, Pre-Command will decide whether or not your strike should be lifted.

**In order to get your strike reviewed or to object to your strike, please refer to the information in High Science Internal Relations Discord server.**

### Suspensions
Suspensions are generally issued when someone breaches HS/HSPS rules or guidelines, with multiple past incidents. Suspensions are heavy punishments and are taken into consideration when promoting people.

### Terminations
Terminations are the heaviest version of punishments. Before a direct termination is issued, Pre-Command and above convene to decide if a termination is warranted. You can also get terminated for acquiring 4 strikes on the spot.

## 2.5 Activity & Quota
As a member of HSPS, you are expected to be at least somewhat active within HSPS and the HS community. If you need to file a Leave of Absence (LOA), do so in [#leave-of-absence](https://discord.com/channels/1258840960734072914/1258877188506386472) (make sure to read the pinned messages).

### Current Quota
(As of Nov. 3rd, 2024)
__In-Game Activity (Shifts)__ - 2 hours (120 mins) per 2 weeks
**OR**
__Training Attendance__ - 1 time per 2 weeks.

Quota checks are performed every 2 weeks on Sundays.

### Quota Rules
As we have this system in place, we have certain rules for our guards to follow.

#### Quota Rule 1: AFKing on shift is not allowed
We do not permit guards going AFK during their shift. If you need to go AFK for some period of time, please head to a security area or security spawn. Furthermore, if you need to be AFK for an extended period of time, please end your shift and get the off team to deal with your situation.

#### Quota Rule 2: You are allowed to log up to 8 hours of quota per day
We care about your health and don’t support excessive playtime. Take regular breaks and monitor your health while on duty. If you feel ill, we recommend not getting on at all.

#### Quota Rule 3: Logging shifts on private servers is not allowed
In case of manual shift logging system being in place, you are not allowed to log shifts on private servers. Shift logging is allowed only on public servers (and special events, if permitted by HSPS leadership).

#### Leave Of Absence:
While on Leave of Absence, you are exempt from the quota and you are allowed to attend any events that may occur while your LOA is active, however we advise you to take a break from the game while your LoA is ongoing as your health always takes priority.

#### Manual shift logging:
When manual shift logging is in place, you may manually start your shift using /shift start and end it using /shift end in [#shift-commands](https://discord.com/channels/1258840960734072914/1287843469813092372). To end your shift you need to attach image evidence. Valid evidence is any screenshot of you in the Security team **showing your entire Roblox client**.

# Section 3 - Operations

## 3.1 Facility Codes
Facility codes help convey the overall threat level and status in a quick and simple manner. This list is ordered from least severe ("lowest") to most severe ("highest"). The most severe code applicable overrides lower codes (for example, if only the requirements for code orange and code red are met, it's just code red).

### Code Green
Code Green indicates there is no imminent threat within the facility and the facility is in normal operations. The facility is in code green:

- At the start of the shift.
- If no facility destruction methods are being prepared in any way.

You are permitted to help operators with any questions they may have and help with running the ECFR. You should also defend the facility from CF, focus on Warhead, FFD and ECFR. If there are no CF, you can play checkers in the security zone.

### Code Blue
Code Blue means there is a minor threat within the facility that may escalate if it is not dealt with. Code Blue is active if:

- The FFD terminal or Warhead laptop is hacked.
 - Code Blue is **not** active if the Warhead laptop is hacked while Warhead is locked due to being cancelled twice, or if the FFD terminal is hacked while FFD is locked.

### Code Orange
Code Orange indicates a moderate threat within the facility that might require further attention.

Code Orange is active if:

-  the computer core is in emergency mode 
-  the warhead protocol is engaged (after the 1st warhead announcement plays until the warhead is cancelled)
-  the ECFR is outside safe operating temperatures (Above 70,000K, below 30,000K)



### Code Red

Code Red indicates a severe threat within the facility.

Code Red is active if:

- The T-SD-02 control panel is activated (the red switch has been operated)
- The warhead is charging or is charged and awaiting activation
- The ECFR temperature is above 80,000 Kelvin.



### Code Black

Code Black indicates that the facility is in imminent danger of being destroyed.

**Security guards must attempt to prevent the destruction of the facility (if possible) and protect data.**

Code Black is active if:

- The warhead is detonating (after the final button was pressed).
- FFD is engaged (after the final button was pressed).
- ECFR is in a meltdown.

You should prioritize aborting FFD (shut down servers) and/or shutting down the ECFR, however use your best judgement to determine the best course of action.

## 3.2 Warnings
Warnings are the type of disciplinary action that you issue to employees when they are interrupting the regular facility operations.

### When Should I Give Warnings?
Warnings are given out on a case-by-case basis, but below are the situations in which you should definitely issue warnings (Non-comprehensive list):
- An employee is in your face, on your body or just being a general nuisance to you or others.
  - If the employee ignores the warning, you may terminate them after 5 seconds. If they stop after your warning and then do it again, you may terminate them immediately.
- An employee is attempting to destabilize the ECFR.
  - "Attempting to destabilize the ECFR" means contributing to raising the ECFR temperature while it is above 70,000 kelvin or lowering it when it is below 30,000 kelvin.
    - Actions that are considered destabilizing: messing with laser boost controls, coolant controls, E-coolant controls, exhaust system controls or trying to increase pump motor strain to dangerous levels.
    - Attempting to break the exhaust system by opening either of the valves to maximum without the exh. system coolant being active warrants 1 warning, after which the termination can be issued if the employee doesn't stop their actions.
    - If the Helium buildup level has surpassed 70%, security can take control of the exhaust system to reduce the buildup down to 30%. During this time, employees that are trying to interfere in security guards' duties should be warned 3 times before the termination. **Within this context, turning off the main coolant pumps, exh. system coolant or closing the Helium vent valve counts as interfering.**
  - In situations where the temperature is above 80,000 kelvin or below 20,000 kelvin, warnings are not required and KoS is allowed, if a control is tampered with that conflicts with your objective.
  - If there are multiple employees near a control that has been messed with, you may warn the one closest to the control.
- An employee is messing with Emergency Cooling Controls
  - Attempting to turn off the E-coolant pump power.
  - Attempting to waste E-coolant if it’s not necessary. Doing this is cause for immediate termination. Reactor Operators may use E-Coolant for faster completion of a task.
- An employee is trying to prevent you or others from shutting down the ECFR during Code Black. It doesn't require warnings, KoS is allowed if they try to stop you.
  - Actions that are considered as interfering: messing with laser boost control, coolant controls, E-coolant controls, trying to increase pump motor strain to dangerous levels, and closing the button box to stop other employees from pressing the button. (See [3.5 RO Cooperation](./3.5%20RO%20Cooperation.md))
- An employee is blocking the controls in such a way that others are unable to interact with them at all, no matter the employee's avatar.
  - You must warn an employee to back away from the controls. If they ignore your warning, you may terminate them. The time before killing an employee is up to discretion of the guard. If the situation is dire, you are permitted to kill them instantly.
- An employee is in a restricted area.
  - If it's **Code Green or Blue**, you must give an employee a warning and ample time to leave the area.
  - If it's **Code Orange, Red or Black**, you are permitted to terminate the trespassing employee on sight (without warnings).
  - If you are in active combat, you do not have to warn an employee immediately. However, when it is safe, you must take measures to get employees out of the restricted area in accordance with the conditions described above.
  - Areas that are considered restricted are: ventilation system, computer core zone (unless it's code black), warhead zone, and the archive room.
    - The FFD Server room is **not** considered a restricted area.

- An employee is impersonating security.
  - If an employee is impersonating security by issuing warnings or wearing a HSPS uniform, then you may issue them a warning to stop, however if they do not stop, you may terminate them.
  - If the employee is ranked Junior Guardsman or above, you can't give them warnings for impersonating security. However, if they are wearing an outfit similar to the morphs in the security spawn, please report them to a member of pre-command.

### When Can I NOT Give Warnings?
You should **NOT** give warnings for the following actions:
1. An employee is hacking, glitching, being disrespectful/toxic, or doing any action that would generally require moderation intervention. In those cases, make a report in #report-center
2. Someone is spamming the controls in a manner that requires said controls to be spammed.
3. An administrator (user on the admin team) is interfering with your duties. If this happens, please report said administrator to IRD leadership.

You are to issue up to a minimum of three verbal warnings before you are permitted to terminate a user for any reason listed above, unless stated otherwise.

If an employee does something that warrants a warning, you must issue a warning to them (unless stated otherwise), so that the enforcement of warnings by all guards is fair for everyone.

## 3.3 Shift KOS
If some employees are intentionally trying to interrupt site operations by messing around, or are attempting to melt the core, you are allowed to issue a shift KoS. Shift KoS' are active until the shift ends and they get deactivated once a new shift begins.

### When can Shift KoS be issued?
If one of these requirements is met, you are allowed to issue a KoS:
- Junior Guardsman+ - Employee was terminated 2+ times for destabilizing the core* / trespassing / griefing RO tasks / pretending to be a security guard (wearing a similar uniform or trying to act like security).
- Senior Guardsman+ - Employee was terminated at least once for destabilizing the core* / trespassing / griefing RO tasks / pretending to be a security guard
- Pre-command+ - Can mark anyone as KoS at any time for any reason.

Once you mark someone as KoS, please notify other guards on duty. Abusing the KOS system will result in a strike. Use it __within reason.__

_*See [3.2 Warnings](./Handbook.md#32-warnings) for actions that are considered destabilizing the ECFR._

## 3.4 Restrictions
You are **not**, unless stated otherwise, allowed to;
1. Go into the facility vents - they are intended for CF (_Climbing onto the vent hatch is permitted for vent peeking, however standing on the vent hatch for prolonged periods of time is prohibited._).
2. Facilitate an instability event (reactor meltdown, FFD, etc.) (_Unless an administrator is conducting a server vote and this event won the vote, or if a pre-command member orders it._).
3. Have a Roblox avatar that in any way shape or form gives you an unfair advantage in combat (_Such as narrow avatars or massively altered hitboxes_).
4. Join the Chaos Forces team if the Security:CF ratio is 1:2 or less **and** backup was called (Such actions will result in a disciplinary action).
5. Leave the security team to purposely prevent data theft from occurring. This is a petty and cowardly tactic considering CF spent a good amount of robux or points on the gamepass/pack. **Do not be a sore looser.**
6. Control the ECFR (excluding exhaust system and e-coolant controls) unless any of the below conditions are met:
   - you are cooperating with Reactor Operators
   - you are preventing the pumps from straining
   - the "temperature low" or "temperature high" warnings on the reactor monitoring screen are active
   - any of the red warnings on the monitoring panels is active
   - any other rules allow you to use the controls (for example the exhaust system rules)

## 3.5 R.O. Cooperation
At any point you may ask the Reactor Operators for cooperation and confirm it when the requirements below are met.
### Requirements
- You have clarified with the Reactor Operators what task they are trying to complete. 
- At least 50% of the RO team confirmed that they are trying to complete the task. (They may also specify how they plan to complete the task)
  - If 50% of the Reactor Operators confirm one task and the other 50% of the Reactor Operators confirm a different task, you are not allowed to do R.O. Cooperation.

After confirming the cooperation you should inform the Reactor Operators, for example by saying "Task 3 confirmed.".

You are allowed to warn employees if they attempt to grief the duties of the Reactor Operators. You may give warnings whenever they attempt to interfere with the current task, or if they are preventing/impeding the efforts of Reactor Operators to reach current task parameters.

If there are no CF and no griefers in-game you may permit Reactor Operators to increase the reactor temperature up to 75,000 Kelvin for faster completion of **task 2** <ins>under the Security supervision</ins>.

After 6 AM you are allowed to aid the reactor shutdown process for Task 5 if all other tasks are completed (failed tasks count as completed) or if the Reactor Operators vote to.

You must warn an employee a total of 3 times before terminating them.
- If an employee has been warned, and the task they were warned in was completed, the warnings carry over to the next task.
- Upon termination, their warnings “Reset”, however you may mark them as KOS when the Shift KoS requirements are met (See [3.3 Shift KoS](./Handbook.md#33-shift-kos))

## 3.6 Backup Requests
If you think that you can’t handle the situation in-game, you can send a backup request to get some help. It should be noted that the backup request cooldown is 30 minutes, per server.
- When requesting backup, please supply your Roblox profile link so people can join through it, and make sure your joins are enabled for everyone.
  - Other forms of supplying a method of joining the game, like RoPro, are also allowed.
  - If you don't include a profile link or an invite link to the server, don't forget to mention a way to join you.
Additionally, if the backup role ping wasn't effective and you still need help, you may ping any online Precommand+ member in your backup request thread and ask them to send the "@here" ping. Provide a reason for your request.

### Requirements: 
- Security:CF ratio is 1:1.5 or less.
- Code Blue+

OR

- An official raid is active (hosted by the Chaos Forces Alliance)

## 3.7 ECFR operations.
This section will cover the most important aspects of Experimental Controlled-Fusion Reactor operations oversight.

### ECFR parameters.
This topic covers all of the ECFR parameters.

#### Plasma Temperature.
The primary ECFR parameter. It indicates how hot the plasma in the reactor is.  
This parameter is measured in Kelvin.  
**Security personnel is required to regularly check the value of this parameter.**  
**During the normal operations, the value of this parameter should stay within 30,000 to 70,000 Kelvin range.**

#### ECFR Reactivity.
This parameter indicates how fast the plasma temperature changes.  
The reactivity is measured in percent.  
Negative reactivity indicates temperature decreasing, while the positive reactivity indicates the temperature increasing. Values close to zero indicate the temperature stability.  
**Security personnel is required to regularly check the value of this parameter.**
1% of reactivity is equivalent to 10 Kelvin per tick temperature change (1 tick is 4 real time seconds).

#### ECFR Laser Power Boost.
This parameter indicates the boost setting of the laser. It is distinct from the actual laser power.
This parameter is measured in percent.  
The laser power boost is regulated by the power boost lever on the Laser Control Panel.
This parameter directly influences laser power.
The lowest possible value of this parameter is 20%.
The highest possible value of this parameter is 100%.

#### ECFR Laser Power.
This parameter indicates the actual power of the laser and is displayed only when the laser is online.
This parameter is measured in percent.
The laser power is constantly fluctuating around the laser power boost setting of the respective laser. 
**This parameter directly influences the helium buildup**.
Note that the laser power can be lower than 20%, which is the minumum laser power boost.

#### ECFR Laser Pressure.
This parameter indicates the pressure inside a single ECFR laser system.
This parameter is measured in kilopascals (kPa).
This parameter influences the growth of the laser temperature. The more pressure, the faster the temperature increases.
Normal values of this parameter are ~100-200 kPa. After the pressure has surpassed 200 kPa, reactor operators can relieve it using the respective switch on the laser control panel.
The value of this parameter depends on the laser boost. The more laser boost, the faster the pressure will grow.

#### ECFR Laser Temperature.
This parameter indicates the temperature of the laser internals.
This parameter is measured in Kelvin.  
There are two factors that influence the value of this parameter:
- The laser boost setting. _The higher the boost, the faster the value is going to increase._
- The laser coolant pump power setting. _The higher the pump power, the faster the value is going to decrease._  

The _laser efficiency, which is documented below_ depends on the value of this parameter. In order to achieve peak laser efficiency, the laser temperature should stay within 450 to 750 Kelvin range, otherwise the laser efficiency will be significantly decreased.

#### ECFR Laser Efficiency.
This parameter indicates how efficient and powerful the ECFR laser is. It is very vague and subjective because there are no indicators that would display the value of this parameter, however there are a few pointers to help you determine the laser efficiency:
- If the laser temperature is within the 450-750 Kelvin range, that means the laser efficiency is at its maximum.
- If the laser boost setting is at maximum and the laser boost gauge displays values above 80%, that means the laser efficiency is at its maximum.
- If the laser boost setting is at minimum and the laser boost gauge displays values below 20%, that means the laser efficiency is at its minumum.

Consequently, **the laser efficiency indirectly affects the ECFR reactivity**.

#### ECFR Laser Fuel.
This parameter indicates the amount of fuel stored in the ECFR laser fuel feed system.  
This parameter is measured in percent.  
This parameter does not affect anything other than the approximate amount of ECFR operation time.  
The _fuel consumption_ depends on two factors:
- The laser efficiency. _The higher the efficiency, the lower the consumption_.
- The laser boost. _The higher the laser boost, the higher the consumption_.

Keep these factors in mind when using the fuel level to your advantage in emergency situations.

#### ECFR Coolant Flow.
This parameter indicates the volume of coolant liquid flowing through the ECFR per second.  
This parameter is measured in cubic meters per second.  
The minimum value of this parameter is 4 m^3/s @ 20% coolant flow setpoint. The maximum value of this parameter is 20 m^3/s @ 100% coolant flow setpoint.  
**This parameter directly influences the ECFR reactivity**.

#### Helium Buildup Level.
This parameter indicates the amount of Helium contained within the ECFR.  
This parameter is measured in percent.  
**This parameter directly influences the ECFR reactivity. Security personnel is required to regularly check the value of this parameter.**  
**The normal values of this parameter are within 30 to 50%.** Anything below may cause rapid temperature drop and anything above can cause its rapid increase.  
The higher the ECFR temperature, the faster the Helium buildup is going to increase.  
*Read further for instructions on managing the Helium buildup level.*

#### Barium Buildup Level.
This parameter indicates the amount of Barium contained within the ECFR.  
This parameter is measured in percent.  
**This parameter directly influences the ECFR reactivity. Security personnel is required to regularly check the value of this parameter.**  
**The normal values of this parameter depend on the current condition of the ECFR and intentions of the Security personnel.** The higher the Barium buildup, the lower the reactivity of the ECFR.
*Read further for instructions on managing the Barium buildup level.*

### ECFR systems.
This topic covers all of the ECFR systems, their significance for Security personnel as well as their influence on operations.

#### ECFR Safeguards.
_This system is currently Work In Progress..._

#### ECFR Lasers.
The ECFR has a set of four reactor lasers designed to directly control the reactivity.  
The parameter responsible for altering the reactivity is *laser boost*. The higher the laser boost, the higher the reactivity.  
This system influences the reactor operations insignificantly. During an emergency, this system generally has the lowest priority for a security guard.

#### ECFR Main Coolant Pumps.
The ECFR has a set of two main coolant pumps designed to directly control the reactivity and keep the ECFR systems cool.  
The parameter responsible for altering the reactivity is *coolant flow*. The higher the coolant flow, the lower the reactivity.  
Security personnel is required to regularly check the *coolant pump strain level*, which is affected by the flow setpoint.  
**In case of high strain alarm sounding, the Security personnel is required to immediately turn the coolant pump(s) off or lower the flow setpoint to minimum, depending on the overall status, to drop the strain level.** Ignoring the high strain alarm may lead to coolant pump motor failure and its unavailability. Engineer personnel is able to repair the coolant pump motor(s).  
**This system causes significant influence on the reactor operations. During an emergency, this system, as well as the exhaust system (described below), generally has the highest priority for a security guard.**

#### ECFR Exhaust System.
The ECFR has the exhaust system in place to rapidly and effectively fight off the *Helium buildup* and, consequently, to decrease the ECFR reactivity.  
The exhaust system has 3 controls: the exhaust system cooling, the Helium vent valve and the Barium injection valve.
- The *exhaust system cooling* is the primary component of the entire exhaust system. It cools down the exhaust system down to 300 Kelvin. **The effectiveness of it is dependent on the main coolant pump power. The higher it is, the more powerful the exhaust system cooling gets. If the main coolant pumps are off, the exhaust system cooling is useless.**
- The *Barium injection valve* controls the amount of Barium being injected into the ECFR. Barium itself is responsible for reducing the reactivity. It does **not** affect the Helium buildup level. **Injecting Barium causes the exhaust system load to increase, without increasing its temperature.**
- The *Helium vent valve* controls the amount of Helium being vented out of the ECFR. Helium itself is responsible for increasing the reactivity. It is **not** dependent on the Barium buildup level. **Venting Helium causes the exhaust system temperature to increase, without increasing its load.**

There are a few important aspects to note about the ECFR exhaust system.
- **If the exhaust system has failed, it will be unavailable for 1 minute.**
- The normal operating temperature for the exhaust system is within the range of 300 to 500 Kelvin. 300K is the lowest temperature you can achieve in this system. **Temperature above 500K will cause the exhaust system load to increase**. From this point, **the hotter the exhaust system, the faster the load will increase.** The upper limit for the exhaust system temperature is 678 Kelvin. The exhaust system is able to be naturally cooled down if the Helium vent valve is closed.
- The normal operating load for the exhaust system is within the range of 0 to 90%. The exhaust system load does not affect its temperature. **After the load has surpassed 90%, it enters an uncontrollable runaway state, resulting in the exhaust system failure.**
- In order for the load to decrease, the Barium injection valve should stay closed and the exhaust system temperature should stay below 500 Kelvin.

### ECFR Emergency Operation Procedures.

#### ECFR Overheating prevention checklist.
1. REPORT to the Reactor Control Room immediately if there is no security personnel posted there.
2. REDUCE the power of every laser to 20%.
3. SWITCH both main core coolant pumps to ON, TURN the coolant pump power to maximum on both pumps.
4. SWITCH the exhaust system cooling to ON.
5. TURN the Helium vent and Barium injection valves to 3.
6. MAINTAIN the laser power at 20%, coolant pumps power at 100%, exhaust system cooling ON, both exhaust system valves on 3.
7. MONITOR the exhaust system temperature <450 Kelvin and exhaust system load <60%.
8. ONCE the exhaust system load has exceeded 60%, TURN Barium injection valve to 2 or 1.
9. REPEAT STEP 6, MONITOR the exhaust system temperature <450 Kelvin and exhaust system load climbing slowly.
10. OBSERVE Helium buildup level dropping, OBSERVE ECFR reactivity dropping.
11. ONCE the ECFR reactivity has lowered <40%, TURN the exhaust system valves to 0.
12. STABILIZE the ECFR temperature <65,000 Kelvin and reactivity at ~0%.
    
# Section 4 - Miscellaneous

## 4.1 MRT
Note: MRT was officially disbanded on 05OCT24.

As HSPS grew bigger, it was obvious that some guards might have a high level of specialization that should be recognized, thus the subdivision MRT (Militarized Response Team) was formed.

### Subdivision List
#### MRT (Militarized Response Team)
**MRT** was an “elite HS unit whose mission is to protect strategic sites from external and internal threats.” They had the best HSPS guards in their ranks, allowing them to cope with any challenge that came their way. MRT had rule bypasses to reach the best combat result.

### Joining MRT
**MRT** was a subdivision within HSPS, which was invite only with guards having to prove themself being capable of joining MRT. It varied on skills and leadership qualities guards may have had, that was beneficial to the subdivision. There were certain requirements within as well to try to receive an invite to MRT. 

## 4.2 Security Protocols

### White Night
**White Night** can be issued by HSPS members ranking **Guardsman+.**
You can issue White Night when the following requirements are met
1. The employees attempting to destabilize the reactor have gone out of Security control;
2. Temperature is outside safe limits (Above 75,000 or below 20,000 kelvin)

White Night regulations are as follows;
- Notify on-duty security (either in team chat or in voice chat if you have a microphone) that the protocol is active.
- You must inform employees that they are required to leave the RCR or face termination.
 - You need to give them ample time to comply with that order.
- You should inform employees every now and then that the reactor control room is under lockdown to avoid confusion.
- The protocol can be active for a maximum of 15 minutes and **must** be lifted within 2 minutes of ECFR reaching safe temperatures (25,000K to 70,000 K)
- The Coolant Pump Room may also be locked down.
- The employee carrying the e-shutdown key can be whitelisted and let into the control room as long as their intention is not to destabilize the reactor.

### Operation Fortitude
**Operation Fortitude** can be issued by **Specialist+.**
You can issue Operation Fortitude when the following requirements are met:
1. The Code is Blue or lower.
2. There are CFs targeting a specific vital area.
3. The ratio of Security to CF is maximum 1:2
4. There are at least 3 security on duty.
5. Security is unable to secure the area CF are holding.

Fortitude regulations are as follows;
- Notify on-duty security (either in team chat or voice chat) that the protocol is active.
- All guards can put on any armor available to them.
- Fortitude may be active for a maximum of 10 minutes, or until the region is secure for at least 5 minutes.
- There is a cooldown of 30 minutes from when the protocol gets lifted.

## 4.3 Private Server Regulations

In Private Servers, the following rules within the HSPS Handbook are voided:
- Section 1: Rules 2, 3, and 4
- Section 2: 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3
- Section 3: 3.1 through 3.5
- Section 4: 4.2

Even though these rules are voided, you are still expected to follow the rules put in place by the Private Server Owner that do not interfere with the non-voided rules in this handbook. If they tell you to get off team, get off team. If they tell you to not kill those who enter the FFD, don’t kill them, and so on.

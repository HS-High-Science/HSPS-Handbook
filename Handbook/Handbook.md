# Section 1 - Rules

## HSPS Rules

### Rule 1: No Leaks.
- All HSPS activities and communications are subject to strict classification measures. This encompasses all communication transmitted within the HSPS Discord, exchanges within team chat in-game, conversations held in HSPS voice channels, and any information about security events.

### Rule 2: Follow the Chain of Command.
- It is required that all Security Personnel obey orders from those who are ranked higher than them in the Chain of Command. It should be noted that an order is different from a request. For example, if a Guardsman requests help from an Officer in protecting the FFD, then the Officer should diligently respond to the request. Should a guard believe that an order given violates an HS/HSPS rule, or is otherwise wrongful, the order must still be obeyed. Still, it's 
**strongly urged** to gather proof and report the order to a member of Pre-Command or above. Following an order that violates a rule **will _not_** result in disciplinary action against those who follow it. This is to prevent you from being punished for insubordination. Furthermore, refrain from mini-modding other guards. Deliberately scrutinizing the actions of others, assuming an HR function, or acting as if you have authority you do not have is **frowned upon**. Additionally, you should not be mini-modding/assuming a moderator function when you are not one. An example of this would be telling CF to use team-chat.

### Rule 3: Use Grammar.
- In public chat, while in-game, adherence to proper grammar, capitalization and punctuation is REQUIRED at all times while on duty. The requirement for full grammar usage is exempted in Discord channels and while speaking in team chat. 

### Rule 4: Act Professional.
Members of HSPS must show a high level of professionalism while on-duty. This means you are not allowed to: 
- Make unnecessary comments outside of team chat
- Dance in public areas 
- Show any immaturity in public areas
- When off duty, you must maintain the professional standards that been set, to keep an example. This means, you don't have to use grammar, just don't be stupid.

Under no circumstances are Security Guards allowed to act toxic towards any other Employee, Staff Member, or Chaos Forces Member (Saying: "ez", "L", "bozo", etc. or humping corpses). This behavior is seen as unprofessional and gives HSPS a bad look. This kind of toxicity will not be tolerated and will be met with strict consequences.

You as a member of HSPS are representing not just yourself but HSPS as a whole. It is required that you remain and act professional in even the most heated circumstances. A bit of fun is okay as it is part of the game, however do not get carried away.


### Rule 5: Be Active.
- Regardless of the existence of a quota, activity within HSPS is expected for all members of HSPS. While real life matters take priority, it is essential to maintain a level of activity. After all, it was your choice to join HSPS, being aware of whatever circumstances you were in. While the bare minimum is the quota, it is encouraged to exceed the quota. Failure to meet the quota on multiple occasions may result in disciplinary measures such as strikes, suspensions, or termination.


### Rule 6: No Disrespect.
- HSPS operates under a structured hierarchy of ranks. However, a person’s rank does not warrant disrespect towards fellow members. Instructors are expected to give the same level of respect to a Cadet as a Cadet would to them. **Every member is obligated to treat others with respect, regardless of their rank**. This principle extends beyond internal HSPS interactions. Any form of aggression or disrespect towards other individuals or groups of people, whether in or outside of HSPS, will not be tolerated. Mutual respect and being the better person is expected out of every member of HSPS.

### Rule 7: No Loopholes/Bending the Rules.
- We are aware that certain individuals may attempt to exploit loopholes or “gray areas” in the rules, in an attempt to circumvent regulation. Such behavior will not be condoned. Swift and severe consequences will be administered to those found attempting to manipulate the rules for their own personal gain.
Rules against loopholes are often ridiculed, but it is a different way of saying “Don’t abuse mistakes made when the guidelines were written.”. For an example, if the rule says "KoS is allowed if the core is above 80.000K", obviously it means 80 thousand kelvin, not 80 kelvin, and you should not abuse the fact that there's a period instead of a comma. Instead, you should report this mistake, so that those who are not as mature as yourself cannot abuse the rule.
Maliciously attempting to find loopholes within the rules will result in disciplinary action.
This is not to be mistaken for misunderstanding the rules. It is blatantly obvious if a misunderstanding is intentional or not.

### Rule 8: Only go on duty on PC.
- You are only permitted to go on duty using a PC (Laptop or Desktop). This is to ensure that we do not encounter any issues that can affect us while patrolling. Mobile devices and consoles have been disallowed due to them having their own limitations.

# Section 2 - Guidelines

## 2.1 In-game communications
This section of the guidelines will go in-depth about interactions with other players in CPUF. In general, when you are talking, please ensure you abide by all HS and HSPS rules, especially HSPS Rule 4 (Act Professional).

### When On Duty
- Your primary communication channel should be team chat. Do not speak in public chat unless it’s absolutely necessary (Ie: Answering a question, Coordinating a shutdown, etc.)
- Please double-check that your messages are being sent to the intended place. If you mean to communicate in team chat, ensure your message is being sent there. Mistakes happen, but they should not happen often.

#### Roblox Voice
Spatial voice is prohibited on-shift for anyone who is not Pre-Command or higher for a multitude of reasons.
- In Spatial Voice, there's no differentiated "team chat", your speech is able to be heard by everyone nearby.
- Numerous players, both guards and employees, may not utilize or have access to Spatial Voice. Consequently, if you employ it, not everyone may have the ability to hear you.
- We have Discord voice channels for a reason, there is no reason to use Spatial Voice.
If you're addressed via Spatial Voice, reply using text chat. If you encounter pressure to use a microphone, treat it as you would any other form of harassment. Pre-Command and above may use Spatial Voice responsibly, but it's strongly advised to not do so for the reasons stated above.

### When Off Duty
When you are not on duty, you are not expected to follow any of the above rules as you are not acting in the official capacity of a guard. Please note that behavior that reflects on HSPS is still punishable under HSPS rules 4 and 6.

## 2.2 Discord Communications
These regulations will go over rules for HS/HSPS discord servers. These guidelines don’t only apply to text channels, but to voice channels as well. Please have Rule 4 in mind before you have any conversations.

### When On Duty
- You are now required to join the On-duty VC(s) as soon as you get on team, as it eases communications for those who do decide to talk in VC
  - You are not required to use a microphone. Simply being in a VC with everyone else is easier for everyone who is using a microphone.
- Should you be heavily outnumbered or outgunned, you are permitted to request backup in the #backup-request channel. (Reference 3.6)
  - When requesting backup, please supply your Roblox profile link so people can join through it, and make sure your joins are enabled for everyone.
  - Other forms of supplying a method of joining the game, like RoPro, are also allowed.

### When Off Duty
Full grammar does not need to be maintained while off-duty. Feel free to talk to other guards without grammar, but please use common sense.

## 2.4 Disciplinary Actions
Here at HSPS, we have a disciplinary system that all members of Pre-Command+ stick to. Disciplinary actions are given at the discretion of Officers and Pre-Command+.

### Commendations
Commendations are issued at the discretion of Officers and above when something you did was considered exemplary. Commendations are only issued when such behavior is witnessed and they do not require hard evidence. Commendations get removed three months after they have been issued.

### Reprimands
Reprimands are issued at the discretion of Officers and above when something you did was considered incorrect, negligent, or generally frowned upon. You don’t have to specifically get a reprimand for breaking rules, but rather your general actions. Reprimands get removed three months after they have been issued.

### Strikes
Strikes are issued at the discretion of Junior Instructors and above when something you did breached HSPS or High Science rules. Strikes are the intermediate version of punishments and stick out during promotions.

#### Types of Strikes
As of writing, there are only two types of strikes
- 1: Disciplinary strikes
  - Disciplinary strikes are strikes that are issued regarding behavior or any other sort of HSPS/HS rule breach.
- 2: Quota Strikes
  - Quota strikes are strikes that are issued for not meeting the quota within a quota cycle.

#### Strike System
We follow a strict strike system that applies to all members of HSPS; guards and instructors alike. The strike system is as follows:
1. First strike: No consequences
2. Second strike: Demotion by one rank^
3. Third strike: Demotion by one rank^
4. Fourth strike: Termination

*Punishments may vary depending on the severity of the offense.*

^ = If you can be demoted. For example, if a Junior Guardsman was on their second strike, they would be immediately terminated, as we don’t __demote to cadet.__

#### Getting rid of strikes
We believe everyone should be given a proper chance to show that they have improved after disciplinary action has been taken against them.
There are two ways of getting your strikes removed:
- 1: Objecting to a Strike 
  - If you think a strike that was issued is unfair, you are able to object to it immediately after it has been issued. Strike objections have a limit, meaning, if you don’t submit your objection within seven days of it being issued, you will not be able to object to it.
- 2: Getting a Strike Reviewed
  - If you believe that your behavior has improved since a strike has been issued, you are able to file a strike review at least 4 months (16 weeks) after it was issued. Here, Pre-Command will decide whether or not your strike should be lifted.
  - In order to get your strike reviewed, please refer to the information in High Science Internal Relations Discord server.

### Suspensions
Suspensions are generally issued when someone breaches HS/HSPS rules or guidelines, with multiple past incidents. Suspensions are heavy punishments and are taken into consideration when promoting people.

### Terminations
Terminations are the heaviest version of punishments. Before a direct termination is issued, Pre-Command and above convene to decide if a termination is warranted. You can also get terminated for acquiring 4 strikes on the spot.

## 2.5 Activity & Quota
As a member of HSPS, you are expected to be at least somewhat active within HSPS and the HS community. If you need to file an LOA, do so in #leave-of-absence.

### Current Quota
(As of August 31st, 2024)
__In-Game Activity (Shifts)__ - 1 hour (60 mins) per month.
**OR**
__Training Attendance__ - Once a Month.

### Quota Rules
As we have this system in place, we have certain rules for our guards to follow.

#### Quota Rule 1: AFKing on shift is not allowed
We do not permit guards going AFK during their shift. If you need to go AFK for some period of time, please head to a security area or security spawn. Furthermore, if you need to be AFK for an extended period of time, please end your shift and get the off team to deal with your situation.

#### Quota Rule 2: You are allowed to log up to 8 hours of quota per day
We care about your health and don’t support excessive playtime. Take regular breaks and monitor your health while on duty. If you feel ill, we recommend not getting on at all.

#### Leave Of Absence:
While on Leave of Absence, you are not permitted to attend any events that may occur while your LOA is active. We have this system in place for guards who need a break as we care about your health and any other reasons. If you fail to adhere to this, you may be subject to disciplinary action.

# Section 3 - Operations

## 3.1 Facility Codes
### Code Green
Code Green indicates there is no imminent threat within the facility and the facility is in normal operations. The facility is in code green:

- At the start of the shift.
- If no facility destruction methods are being prepared in any way.

You are permitted to help operators with any questions they may have and help with running the ECFR. You should also defend the facility from CF, focus on Warhead, FFD and ECFR.

### Code Blue
Code Blue means there is a minor threat within the facility that may escalate if it is not dealt with. Code Blue is active if:

- The FFD terminal or Warhead laptop is hacked.

Code Blue does **not** activate if the Warhead laptop is hacked while Warhead is locked due to being cancelled twice, or if the FFD terminal is hacked while FFD is locked.



### Code Orange
Code Orange indicates a moderate threat within the facility that needs to be neutralised promptly. 

Code Orange is active if:-

-  the computer core is in emergency mode 
-  the warhead protocol is engaged
-  the ECFR is outside safe operating temperatures (Above 70,000K, below 30,000K)



### Code Red

Code Red indicates a severe threat within the facility. The priority is to neutralise that threat immediately.

**If Code Red is active, security guards must immediately stop what they are doing and deal with the threat.**

Code Red is active if:-

- The T-SD-02 control panel is activated (the red switch has been operated)
- The warhead is charging or is charged and awaiting activation
- The ECFR temperature is above 80,000 Kelvin.



### Code Black

Code Black indicates that the facility is in imminent danger of being destroyed. The priority is to prevent facility destruction or evacuate employees from the facility and protect the data.

**Security guards must attempt to prevent the destruction of the facility (if possible) and protect data.**

Code Black is active if:

- The warhead is detonating.
- FFD is engaged.
- ECFR is in a meltdown.

Your priority here is to attempt to abort FFD (shut down servers) or shut down the ECFR. If these facility conservation options have expired and detonation is inevitable, your priority is to protect the data and evacuate the employees from the facility.

## 3.2 Warnings
Warnings are the type of disciplinary action that you issue to employees when they are being a nuisance to you and other players.

### When Can I Give Warnings?
Warnings are given out on a case-by-case basis, but these are the situations in which you can give warnings (Non-comprehensive list):
- An employee is in your face, on your body or just being a general nuisance to you.
  - If the employee ignores the warning, you may terminate them after 5 seconds.
- An employee is attempting to destabilize the ECFR
  - Destabilizing by raising the temperature above 70,000 kelvin or below 30,000 kelvin.
  - Actions that are considered destabilizing: messing with laser boost control, coolant controls, E-coolant controls, relief controls^ and trying to increase pump motor strain to dangerous levels.
  - ^At any time of operations you can take control of the relief valves if either of the buildups is above 40% and keep controlling them until both buildup levels are below 20%. During that time you can also warn employees putting either of the valves to 1 or 0. **Note:** Barium buildup level is to be ignored during operations.
  - In situations where the temperature is above 80,000 kelvin or below 20,000 kelvin, warnings are not required and KoS is allowed, if a control is tampered with that conflicts with your objective.
- An employee is messing with Emergency Cooling Controls
  - Attempting to turn off the E-coolant pump power.
  - Attempting to waste E-coolant if it’s not necessary. Doing this is cause for immediate termination. Reactor Operators may use E-Coolant for faster completion of a task.
- An employee is trying to prevent you or others from shutting down the ECFR during Code Black. It doesn't require warnings, KoS is allowed if they stop you.
  - Actions that are considered as interference: messing with laser boost control, coolant controls, E-coolant controls, trying to increase pump motor strain to dangerous levels, and closing the button box to stop other employees from pressing the button. (Review 3.5)
- An employee is blocking the controls in such a way that others are unable to interact with them at all, no matter the employee's avatar.
  - You must warn an employee to back away from the controls. The time before killing an employee is up to discretion of the guard. If the situation is dire, you are permitted to kill them instantly.
- An employee is in a restricted area.
  - If it's **Code Green or Blue**, you must give an employee at least 1 warning and 15 seconds to leave the area.
  - If it's **Code Orange, Red or Black**, you are permitted to terminate the trespassing employee on sight (without warnings).
  - If you are in active combat, you do not have to warn an employee immediately. However, when it is safe, you must take measures to get employees out of the restricted area in accordance with the conditions described above.
  - **NOTE**: Server room is **not** considered a restricted area.

- An employee is impersonating security.
  - If an employee is impersonating security by issuing warnings or wearing the uniform, then you may issue them a warning to stop, however if they do not, you may terminate them.
  - The only exception to this, if the employee is ranked Junior Guardsman+.

### When Can I NOT Give Warnings?
You should **NOT** give warnings for the following circumstances:
1. An employee is hacking, glitching, being disrespectful/toxic, or doing any action that would generally require moderation intervention. In those cases, make a report in #report-center
2. Someone is spamming the controls in a manner that requires said controls to be spammed.

You are to issue up to a minimum of three verbal warnings before you are permitted to terminate a user for any reason listed under 3.2, unless stated otherwise.

If an employee does something that is warnable, you must issue a warning to them, so that the enforcement of warnings by all guards is fair for all.

## 3.3 Shift KOS
If some employees are intentionally trying to interrupt site operations by messing around, or are attempting to melt the core, you are allowed to issue a shift KoS. Shift KoS(s) are active until the shift ends and they get deactivated once the new shift begins.

### When can Shift KoS be issued?
If one of these requirements is met, you are allowed to issue a KoS:
- Junior Guardsman+ - Employee was terminated 2+ times for destabilizing the core* / trespassing / griefing RO tasks / employee is pretending to be a security guard (wearing a similar uniform and trying to act like security; Exception: The employee is Junior Guardsman+)
- Senior Guardsman+ - Employee was terminated at least once for destabilizing the core* / trespassing / griefing RO tasks / acting like security
- Deputy Director+ - Can mark anyone as KoS at any time.

Shift KoS should be announced in team chat. After that, it’s active.

**REMEMBER!** KoS doesn’t let you instantly kill the employee just when you see them. They can be instantly terminated (without warnings) for any action stated in 3.2.

Abusing the KOS system will result in a strike. Use it __within reason.__

_*See 3.2 "Warnings" for actions that are considered destabilizing the ECFR._

## 3.4 Restrictions
You are **not**, under any circumstances, allowed to;
1. Go into the facility vents - they are intended for CF (_Climbing onto the vent hatch is permitted for vent peeking, however standing on the vent hatch for prolonged periods of time is prohibited._).
2. Facilitate an instability event (reactor meltdown, FFD, etc.) (_Unless an administrator is conducting a server vote and this event won the vote_).
3. Have a Roblox avatar that in any way shape or form gives you an unfair advantage in combat (_Such as narrow avatars or massively altered hitboxes_).
4. Join the Chaos Forces team if the Security:CF ratio is 1:2 or less and backup was called (Such actions will result in a disciplinary action) (1 CF with Advanced Armor is considered as 2 regular CF).
5. Leave the security team to purposely prevent data theft from occurring. This is petty and cowardly tactic considering CF spent a good amount of robux or points on the gamepass/pack. **Do not be a sore looser.**
6. Speak in the backup request forum threads while playing on the Chaos Forces team. Because of this, people viewing the thread may be confused, thinking you're playing as Security.

## 3.5 R.O. Cooperation
### Requirements
- You have clarified with the Reactor Operators what task they are trying to complete. 
- At least 50% of the RO team should confirm that they are going to complete the tasks. (They may also specify how they plan to complete the task)
  - If 50% say one thing, and 50% say another thing, you are not allowed to do R.O. Cooperation

You are allowed to warn employees if they attempt to grief the duties of the Reactor Operators. You may give warnings whenever they attempt to interfere with the current task, or if they are preventing/impeding the efforts of Reactor Operators to reach current task parameters.

After 6 AM you are allowed to aid the reactor shutdown process for Task 5 if all other tasks are complete/the Reactor Operators vote to.

You must warn an employee a total of 3 Times before terminating them.
- If an employee has been warned, and the task they were warned in was completed, the warnings carry over to the next task.
- Upon termination, their warnings “Reset”, however you may mark them as KOS when the Shift KoS requirements are met (Shown in Section 3.3)	

## 3.6 Backup Requests
If you think that you can’t handle the situation in-game, you can send a backup request to get some help. It should be noted that the backup-request cooldown is 30 minutes, per server.
Additionally, if the backup role ping wasn't effective and you still need help, you may ping any online Precommand+ member in your backup request thread and ask them to send the "@here" ping. Provide a reason for your request.

### Requirements: 
- CF:Security ratio is 2:1 or more. (1 Heavy Armored CF = 2 CF)
- Code Blue+

OR

- An official raid is active (hosted by the Chaos Forces Alliance or High Science Administration)

# Section 4 - Miscellaneous

## 4.1 MRT
As HSPS grew bigger, it was obvious that some guards might have a high level of specialization that should be recognized, thus the subdivision MRT (Militarized Response Team) was formed.

### Subdivision List
#### MRT (Militarized Response Team)
**MRT** is an “elite HS unit whose mission is to protect strategic sites from external and internal threats.” They have the best HSPS guards in their ranks, allowing them to cope with any challenge that comes their way. MRT has rule bypasses to reach the best combat result.

### Joining MRT
**MRT** is a subdivision within HSPS, which is currently invite only with guards having to prove themself being capable of joining MRT. It varies on skills and leadership qualities you may have, that is beneficial to the subdivision. There will be certain requirements within as well to try to receive an invite to MRT. 

## 4.2 Security Protocols

### White Night
**White Night** can be issued by **Guardsman+.**
You can issue White Night when the following requirements are met
1. The employees attempting to destabilize the reactor have gone out of Security control;
2. Temperature is outside safe limits (Above 75,000 or below 20,000 kelvin)
White Night regulations are as follows;
- Notify on-duty security in team chat by saying “White Night has been issued.”
- You must inform employees that they are required to leave the CR or face termination.
  - You need to give them 15 seconds to comply with that order.
- You need to re-inform employees once every 3 minutes that the control room is under lockdown.
- The protocol can be active for a maximum of 15 minutes and **must** be lifted within 2 minutes of ECFR reaching safe temperatures (25,000K to 70,000 K)
- The Coolant Pump Room may also be locked down.

### Operation Fortitude
**Operation Fortitude** can be issued by **Specialist+.**
You can issue Operation Fortitude when the following requirements are met:
1. The Code is Blue or lower.
2. There are CFs targeting a specific vital area.
3. The ratio of Security to CF is maximum 1:2.5 (Heavy Armor CF = 2 CF)
4. There are at least 3 security on duty.
5. Security is unable to secure the area CF are holding.

Fortitude regulations are as follows;
- Notify on-duty security in team chat by saying “Fortitude is Active.”
- All guards can put on any armor available to them.
- Fortitude may be active for a maximum of 10 minutes, or until the region is secure for at least 5 minutes.
- There is a cooldown of 30 minutes from when the protocol gets lifted.

## 4.3 Private Server Regulations

In Private Servers, the following rules within the HSPS Handbook are voided:
- Section 1: Rules 2, 3, and 4
- Section 2: 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3
- Section 3: 3.1 through 3.5
- Section 4: 4.2

Even though these rules are voided, you are still expected to follow the rules put in place by the Private Server Owner that do not interfere with the non-voided rules in this handbook. If they tell you to get off team, get off team. If they tell you to not kill those who enter the FFD, don’t kill them.

# ECFR operations.
This file will cover the most important aspects of Experimental Controlled-Fusion Reactor operations oversight.

## ECFR parameters.
This topic covers all of the ECFR parameters.

### Plasma Temperature.
The primary ECFR parameter. It indicates how hot the plasma in the reactor is.  
This parameter is measured in Kelvin.
**During the normal operations, the value of this parameter should stay within 30,000 to 70,000 Kelvin range.**

### ECFR Reactivity.
Another crucial ECFR parameter. It indicates how fast the plasma temperature changes.  
The reactivity is measured in percent.  
Negative reactivity indicates temperature decreasing, while the positive reactivity indicates the temperature increasing. Values close to zero indicate the temperature stability.  
1% of reactivity is equivalent to 10 Kelvin per tick temperature change (1 tick is 4 real time seconds).

### ECFR Laser Boost.
This parameter indicates the boost setting of the laser. It is also referred to as "Laser power".  
This parameter is measured in percent.  
The laser power is constantly fluctuating around a _setpoint_ regulated by the respective lever on the Laser Control Panel.  
**This parameter directly influences the ECFR reactivity**.  
The lowest values of this parameter are 0% _(while the laser is offline)_, less than 20% _(while the laser is online, low efficiency)_ and ~20% _(while the laser is online, peak efficiency)_.  
The highest values of this parameter are ~60-70% _(low efficiency)_ and ~80-90% _(peak efficiency)_.

### ECFR Laser Temperature.
This parameter indicates the temperature of the laser internals.
This parameter is measured in Kelvin.  
There are two factors that influence the value of this parameter:
- The laser boost setting. _The higher the boost, the faster the value is going to increase._
- The laser coolant pump power setting. _The higher the pump power, the faster the value is going to decrease._  

The _laser efficiency, which is documented below_ depends on the value of this parameter. In order to achieve peak laser efficiency, the laser temperature should stay within 450 to 750 Kelvin range, otherwise the laser efficiency will be significantly decreased.

### ECFR Laser Efficiency.
This parameter indicates how efficient and powerful the ECFR laser is. It is very vague and subjective because there are no indicators that would display the value of this parameter, however there are a few pointers to help you determine the laser efficiency:
- If the laser temperature is within the 450-750 Kelvin range, that means the laser efficiency is at its maximum.
- If the laser boost setting is at maximum and the laser boost gauge displays values above 80%, that means the laser efficiency is at its maximum.
- If the laser boost setting is at minimum and the laser boost gauge displays values below 20%, that means the laser efficiency is at its minumum.

Consequently, **the laser efficiency indirectly affects the ECFR reactivity**.

### ECFR Laser Fuel.
This parameter indicates the amount of fuel stored in the ECFR laser fuel feed system.  
This parameter is measured in percent.  
This parameter does not affect anything other than the approximate amount of ECFR operation time.  
The _fuel consumption_ depends on two factors:
- The laser efficiency. _The higher the efficiency, the lower the consumption_.
- The laser boost. _The higher the laser boost, the higher the consumption_.

Keep these factors in mind when using the fuel level to your advantage in emergency situations.

### ECFR Coolant Flow.
This parameter indicates the volume of coolant liquid flowing through the ECFR per second.  
This parameter is measured in cubic meters per second.
The minimum value of this parameter is 4 m^3/s @ 20% coolant pump power. The maximum value of this parameter is 20 m^3/s @ 100% coolant pump power.
**This parameter directly influences the ECFR reactivity**.

## ECFR systems.
This topic covers all of the ECFR systems, their significance for Security personnel as well as their influence on operations.

### Safeguards.
_This system is currently Work In Progress..._

### Lasers.
The ECFR has a set of four power lasers designed to directly increase the reactivity
## ECFR overheating prevention checklist.
1. REPORT to the Reactor Control Room immediately if there is no security personnel posted there.
2. REDUCE the power of every laser to 20%.
3. SWITCH both main core coolant pumps to ON, TURN the coolant pump power to maximum on both pumps.
4. SWITCH the exhaust system coolant pump to ON.
5. TURN the Helium vent and Barium injection valves to 3.
6. MAINTAIN the laser power at 20%, coolant pumps power at 100%, exhaust system pump ON, both exhaust system valves on 3.
7. MONITOR the exhaust system temperature <450 Kelvin and exhaust system load <50%.
8. ONCE the exhaust system load has exceeded 50%, TURN both exhaust system valves to 2.
9. REPEAT STEP 6, MONITOR the exhaust system temperature <450 Kelvin and exhaust system load climbing slowly.
10. OBSERVE Helium buildup level dropping, OBSERVE ECFR reactivity dropping.
11. ONCE the ECFR reactivity has lowered <40%, TURN the exhaust system valves to 0.
12. STABILIZE the ECFR temperature <65,000 Kelvin and reactivity at ~0%.

## Restrictions
You are **not**, under any circumstances, allowed to;
1. Go into the facility vents - they are intended for CF (_Climbing onto the vent hatch is permitted for vent peeking_).
2. Facilitate an instability event (reactor meltdown, FFD, etc.) (_Unless an administrator is conducting a server vote_).
3. Have a Roblox avatar that in any way shape or form that gives you an unfair advantage in combat (_Such as narrow avatars or massively altered hitboxes_).
4. Join the Chaos Forces team if the CF:Security ratio is 2:1 or more and backup was called (Such actions will result in a disciplinary action) (1 CF with Advanced Armor is considered as 2 regular CF).

## Backup Requests
If you think that you canâ€™t handle the situation in-game, you can send a backup request to get some help. It should be noted that the backup request cooldown is 30 minutes, per server.
- When requesting backup, please supply your Roblox profile link so people can join through it, and make sure your joins are enabled for everyone.
  - Other forms of supplying a method of joining the game, like RoPro, are also allowed.
  - If you don't include a profile link or an invite link to the server, don't forget to mention a way to join you.
- Additionally, if the backup role ping wasn't effective and you still need help, you may ping any online Precommand+ member in your backup request thread and ask them to send the "@here" ping. Provide a reason for your request.

### Requirements: 
- Security:CF ratio is 1:2 or more.
- Code Blue+

OR

- An official raid is active (hosted by the Chaos Forces Alliance)

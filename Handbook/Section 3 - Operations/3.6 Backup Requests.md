## Backup Requests
If you think that you canâ€™t handle the situation in-game, you can send a backup request to get some help. It should be noted that the backup-request cooldown is 30 minutes, per server.
Additionally, if the backup role ping wasn't effective and you still need help, you may ping any online Junior Instructor+ in your backup request thread and ask them to send the "@here" ping. Provide a reason for your request.

### Requirements: 
- CF:Security ratio is 2:1 or more. (1 Heavy Armored CF = 2 CF)
- Code Blue+

OR

- An official raid is active (hosted by the Chaos Forces Alliance or High Science Administration)

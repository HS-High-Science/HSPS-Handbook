## ECFR overheating prevention checklist.
This is the approximate list of actions that Security personnel is expected to perform when they notice the ECFR temperature has exceeded 70,000 Kelvin.

1. REPORT to the Reactor Control Room immediately if there is no security personnel posted there.
2. REDUCE the power of every laser to 20%.
3. SWITCH both main core coolant pumps to ON, TURN the coolant pump power to maximum on both pumps.
4. SWITCH the exhaust system coolant pump to ON.
5. TURN the Helium vent and Barium injection valves to 3.
6. MAINTAIN the laser power at 20%, coolant pumps power at 100%, exhaust system pump ON, both exhaust system valves on 3.
7. MONITOR the exhaust system temperature <450 Kelvin and exhaust system load <50%.
8. ONCE the exhaust system load has exceeded 50%, TURN both exhaust system valves to 2.
9. REPEAT STEP 6, MONITOR the exhaust system temperature <450 Kelvin and exhaust system load climbing slowly.
10. OBSERVE Helium buildup level dropping, OBSERVE ECFR reactivity dropping.
11. ONCE the ECFR reactivity has lowered <40%, TURN the exhaust system valves to 0.
12. STABILIZE the ECFR temperature <65,000 Kelvin and reactivity at ~0%.

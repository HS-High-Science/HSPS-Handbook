## Warnings
Warnings are the type of disciplinary action that you issue to employees when they are being a nuisance to you and other players.

### When Can I Give Warnings?
Warnings are given out on a case-by-case basis, but these are the situations in which you can give warnings (Non-comprehensive list):
- An employee is in your face, on your body or just being a general nuisance to you.
  - If the employee ignores the warning, you may terminate them after 5 seconds.
- An employee is attempting to destabilize the ECFR
  - Destabilizing by raising the temperature above 70,000 kelvin or below 30,000 kelvin.
  - Actions that are considered destabilizing: messing with laser boost control, coolant controls, E-coolant controls, and trying to increase pump motor strain to dangerous levels.
  - In situations where the temperature is above 80,000 kelvin or below 20,000 kelvin, warnings are not required and KoS is allowed, if a control is tampered with that conflicts with your objective.
- An employee is messing with Emergency Cooling Controls
  - Attempting to turn off the E-coolant pump power.
  - Attempting to waste E-coolant if itâ€™s not necessary. Doing this is cause for immediate termination. Reactor Operators may use E-Coolant for faster completion of a task.
- An employee is trying to prevent you or others from shutting down the ECFR during Code Black. It doesn't require warnings, KoS is allowed if they stop you.
  - Actions that are considered as interference: messing with laser boost control, coolant controls, E-coolant controls, trying to increase pump motor strain to dangerous levels, and closing the button box to stop other employees from pressing the button. (Review 3.5)
- An employee is blocking the controls in such a way that others are unable to interact with them at all, no matter the employee's avatar.
  - You must warn an employee and give them **10** seconds to back away from the controls.
- An employee is in a restricted area.
  - If it's **Code Green or Blue**, you must give an employee at least 1 warning and 15 seconds to leave the area.
  - If it's **Code Orange, Red or Black**, you are permitted to terminate the trespassing employee on sight (without warnings) if letting them out alive could compromise the safety of your mission.
  - If you are in active combat, you do not have to warn an employee immediately. However, when it is safe, you must take measures to get employees out of the restricted area in accordance with the conditions described above.
  - **NOTE**: Server room is **not** considered a restricted area.

- An employee is impersonating security.
  - If an employee is impersonating security by issuing warnings or wearing the uniform, then you may issue them a warning to stop, however if they do not, you may terminate them.
  - The only exception to this, if the employee is ranked Junior Guardsman+.

### When Can I NOT Give Warnings?
You should **NOT** give warnings for the following circumstances:
1. An employee is hacking, glitching, being disrespectful/toxic, or doing any action that would generally require moderation intervention. In those cases, make a report in #report-center
2. Someone is spamming the controls in a manner that requires said controls to be spammed.

You are to issue up to a minimum of three verbal warnings before you are permitted to terminate a user for any reason listed under 3.2, unless stated otherwise.

If an employee does something that is warnable, you must issue a warning to them, so that the enforcement of warnings by all guards is fair for all.

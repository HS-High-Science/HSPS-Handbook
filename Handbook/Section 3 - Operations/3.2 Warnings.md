## Warnings
Warnings are the type of disciplinary action that you issue to employees when they are being a nuisance to you and other players.

### When Can I Give Warnings?
Warnings are given out on a case-by-case basis, but these are the situations in which you can give warnings (Non-comprehensive);
- An employee is in your face, on your body or just being a general nuisance to you.
 - If the employee ignores the warning, you may terminate them after 5 seconds.
- An employee is attempting to destabilize the ECFR
  - Destabilize by raising the temperature above 70,000 kelvin or below 30,000 kelvin.
  - Actions that are considered destabilizing are: messing with laser boost control, coolant controls, E-coolant controls, and trying to increase pump motor strain to dangerous levels.
  - In situations where the temperature is above 80,000 kelvin or below 20,000 kelvin, warnings are not required and KoS is allowed, if a control is tampered with that conflicts with your objective.
- An employee is messing with Emergency Cooling Controls
  - Attempting to turn off the E-coolant pump power.
  - Attempting to waste E-coolant if itâ€™s not necessary. Doing this is cause for immediate termination. Reactor Operators may use E-Coolant for faster completion of a task.
- An employee is trying to prevent you or others from shutting down the ECFR during Code Black. It doesn't require warnings, KoS is allowed if they stop you.
  - Actions that are considered as interference: messing with laser boost control, coolant controls, E-coolant controls, trying to increase pump motor strain to dangerous levels, and closing the button box to stop other employees from pressing the button. (Review 3.5)
- An employee is in a restricted area.
  - You must give an employee at least 1 warning and 15 seconds to leave the area.
  - If you are in active combat, you do not have to tell employees to immedietely. However, when it is safe to, you must tell any employees in the restricted area to leave.

### When Can I NOT Give Warnings?
You should **NOT** give warnings for the following circumstances:
1. An employee is hacking, glitching, being disrespectful/toxic, or doing any action that would generally require moderation intervention. In those cases, make a report in #report-center
2. Someone is spamming the controls in a manner that requires said controls to be spammed.

You are to issue up to a minimum of three verbal warnings before you are permitted to terminate a user for any reason listed under 3.2, unless stated otherwise.

If an employee does something that is warnable, you must issue a warning to them, so that the enforcement of warnings by all guards is fair for all.

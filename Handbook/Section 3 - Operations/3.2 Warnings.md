## Warnings
Warnings are the type of disciplinary action that you issue to employees when they are being a nuisance to you and other players.

### When Can I Give Warnings?
Warnings are given out on a case-by-case basis, but these are the situations in which you can give warnings (Non-comprehensive list):
- An employee is in your face, on your body or just being a general nuisance to you or others.
  - If the employee ignores the warning, you may terminate them after 5 seconds. If they stop after your warning and then do it again, you may terminate them immediately.
- An employee is attempting to destabilize the ECFR
  - Attempting to destabilize the ECFR is raising the temperature while the temperature is above 70,000 kelvin or lowering it when it's below 30,000 kelvin.
    - Actions that are considered destabilizing: messing with laser boost control, coolant controls, E-coolant controls, exhaust system controls^ and trying to increase pump motor strain to dangerous levels.
      - ^At any time of operations you can take control of the exhaust system controls if either of the buildups is above 40% and keep controlling them until both buildup levels are below 20%. During that time you can also warn employees putting either of the relief controls to 1 or 0.
      - **Note:** Barium buildup level is to be ignored during operations.
  - In situations where the temperature is above 80,000 kelvin or below 20,000 kelvin, warnings are not required and KoS is allowed, if a control is tampered with that conflicts with your objective.
  - If there are multiple employees near a control that has been messed with, you may warn the one closest to the control.
- An employee is messing with Emergency Cooling Controls
  - Attempting to turn off the E-coolant pump power.
  - Attempting to waste E-coolant if itâ€™s not necessary. Doing this is cause for immediate termination. Reactor Operators may use E-Coolant for faster completion of a task.
- An employee is trying to prevent you or others from shutting down the ECFR during Code Black. It doesn't require warnings, KoS is allowed if they try to stop you.
  - Actions that are considered as interfering: messing with laser boost control, coolant controls, E-coolant controls, trying to increase pump motor strain to dangerous levels, and closing the button box to stop other employees from pressing the button. (See [3.5 RO Cooperation](./3.5%20RO%20Cooperation.md))
- An employee is blocking the controls in such a way that others are unable to interact with them at all, no matter the employee's avatar.
  - You must warn an employee to back away from the controls. If they ignore your warning, you may terminate them. The time before killing an employee is up to discretion of the guard. If the situation is dire, you are permitted to kill them instantly.
- An employee is in a restricted area.
  - If it's **Code Green or Blue**, you must give an employee a warning and ample time to leave the area.
  - If it's **Code Orange, Red or Black**, you are permitted to terminate the trespassing employee on sight (without warnings).
  - If you are in active combat, you do not have to warn an employee immediately. However, when it is safe, you must take measures to get employees out of the restricted area in accordance with the conditions described above.
  - Areas that are considered restricted are: ventilation system, computer core zone (unless it's code black), warhead zone, and the archive room.
    - The FFD Server room is **not** considered a restricted area.

- An employee is impersonating security.
  - If an employee is impersonating security by issuing warnings or wearing a HSPS uniform, then you may issue them a warning to stop, however if they do not stop, you may terminate them.
  - If the employee is ranked Junior Guardsman or above, you can't give them warnings for impersonating security. However, if they are wearing an outfit similar to the morphs in the security spawn, please report them to a member of pre-command.

### When Can I NOT Give Warnings?
You should **NOT** give warnings for the following actions:
1. An employee is hacking, glitching, being disrespectful/toxic, or doing any action that would generally require moderation intervention. In those cases, make a report in #report-center
2. Someone is spamming the controls in a manner that requires said controls to be spammed.
3. An administrator (user on the admin team) is interfering with your duties. If this happens, please report said administrator to IRD leadership.

You are to issue up to a minimum of three verbal warnings before you are permitted to terminate a user for any reason listed above, unless stated otherwise.

If an employee does something that warrants a warning, you must issue a warning to them, so that the enforcement of warnings by all guards is fair for all.

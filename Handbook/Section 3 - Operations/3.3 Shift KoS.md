## Shift KOS
If some employees are intentionally trying to interrupt site operations by messing around, or are attempting to melt the core, you are allowed to issue a shift KoS. Shift KoS(s) are active until the shift ends and they get deactivated once the new shift begins.

### When can Shift KoS be issued?
If one of these requirements is met, you are allowed to issue a KoS:
- Junior Guardsman+ - Employee was terminated 2+ times for destabilizing the core* / trespassing / griefing RO tasks / employee is pretending to be a security guard (wearing a similar uniform and trying to act like security; Exception: The employee is Junior Guardsman+)
- Senior Guardsman+ - Employee was terminated at least once for destabilizing the core* / trespassing / griefing RO tasks / acting like security
- Deputy Director+ - Can mark anyone as KoS at any time.

Shift KoS should be announced in team chat. After that, it’s active.

**REMEMBER!** KoS doesn’t let you instantly kill the employee just when you see them. They can be instantly terminated (without warnings) for any action stated in 3.2.

Abusing the KOS system will result in a strike. Use it __within reason.__

_*See 3.2 "Warnings" for actions that are considered destabilizing the ECFR._

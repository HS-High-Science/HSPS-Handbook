## Shift KOS
If some employees are intentionally trying to interrupt site operations by messing around, or are attempting to melt the core, you are allowed to issue a shift KoS. Shift KoS(s) are active until the shift ends.

### When can they be issued?
If one of these requirements are met you are allowed to issue a KoS:
- Guard+ - Employee was terminated 2+ times for melting the core / trespassing / griefing RO tasks / employee is pretending to be a security guard (wearing a similar uniform and trying to act like security; Exception: The employee is Guard+)
- Task Force+ - Employee was terminated at least once for melting the core / trespassing / griefing RO tasks / acting as security
- Deputy Director+ - Can mark anyone as KoS at any time.

Shift KoS should be announced in team chat. After that, it’s active.

**REMEMBER!** KoS doesn’t let you instantly kill the employee just when you see them. They can be instantly terminated (without warnings) for any action stated in 3.2.

Abusing the KOS system will result in a strike. Use it __within reason.__

## Shift KOS
If some employees are intentionally trying to interrupt site operations by messing around, or are attempting to melt the core, you are allowed to issue a shift KoS. Shift KoS' are active until the shift ends and they get deactivated once a new shift begins.

### When can Shift KoS be issued?
If one of these requirements is met, you are allowed to issue a KoS:
- Junior Guardsman+ - Employee was terminated 2+ times for destabilizing the core* / trespassing / griefing RO tasks / pretending to be a security guard (wearing a similar uniform or trying to act like security).
- Senior Guardsman+ - Employee was terminated at least once for destabilizing the core* / trespassing / griefing RO tasks / pretending to be a security guard
- Pre-command+ - Can mark anyone as KoS at any time for any reason.

Abusing the KOS system will result in a strike. Use it __within reason.__

_*See [3.2 Warnings](./3.2%20Warnings.md) for actions that are considered destabilizing the ECFR._

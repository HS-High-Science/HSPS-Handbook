## Facility Codes
### Code Green
Code Green indicates there is no imminent threat within the facility and the facility is in normal operations. The facility is in code green:

- At the start of the shift.
- If no facility destruction methods are being prepared in any way.

You are permitted to help operators with any questions they may have and help with running the ECFR. You should also defend the facility from CF, focus on Warhead, FFD and ECFR.

### Code Blue
Code Blue means there is a minor threat within the facility that may escalate if it is not dealt with. Code Blue is active if:

- The FFD terminal or Warhead laptop is hacked.

Code Blue does **not** activate if the Warhead laptop is hacked while Warhead is locked due to being cancelled twice, or if the FFD terminal is hacked while FFD is locked.



### Code Orange
Code Orange indicates a moderate threat within the facility that needs to be neutralised promptly. 

Code Orange is active if:-

-  the computer core is in emergency mode 
-  the warhead protocol is engaged
-  the ECFR is outside safe operating temperatures (Above 70,000K, below 30,000K)



### Code Red

Code Red indicates a severe threat within the facility. The priority is to neutralise that threat immediately.

**If Code Red is active, security guards must immediately stop what they are doing and deal with the threat.**

Code Red is active if:-

- The T-SD-02 control panel is activated (the red switch has been operated)
- The warhead is charging or is charged and awaiting activation
- The ECFR temperature is above 80,000 Kelvin.



### Code Black

Code Black indicates that the facility is in imminent danger of being destroyed. The priority is to prevent facility destruction or evacuate employees from the facility and protect the data.

**Security guards must attempt to prevent the destruction of the facility (if possible) and protect data.**

Code Black is active if:

- The warhead is detonating.
- FFD is engaged.
- ECFR is in a meltdown.

Your priority here is to attempt to abort FFD (shut down servers) or shut down the ECFR. If these facility conservation options have expired and detonation is inevitable, your priority is to protect the data and evacuate the employees from the facility.

## Facility Codes
### Code Green
Code Green is the state you will most often be in. If you are in code green, you are expected to help employees out with any questions and help the Reactor Operators run the ECFR. Code green is basically active if there is no active threat on site, warhead and FFD being inactive, and the ECFR being stable.

### Code Blue
Code Blue is the other state you will be in most often. Code Blue is active from the moment the first FFD hack announcement is played/the terminal is hacked, or if the laptop in Warhead Control Room is bypassed. It should be noted that Code Blue is not active after the first FFD hack announcement if the FFD is locked, and Code Blue is not active if the laptop if hacked in the Warhead Control Room if the Warhead is locked (Cancelled Twice). **You are required to try to stop malicious events.**

### Code Orange
Code Orange indicates that there is a more significant threat present in the facility. This code is in effect if the FFD Computer Core is in emergency mode (indicated by the emergency mode switch in FFD CR being active), if the Warhead Protocol is engaged, or if the ECFR temperature is above 70,000 or below 30,000 kelvin. **You are required to try to stop malicious events.**

### Code Red
Code Red indicates an imminent threat is present that needs to be eliminated as soon as possible. Code Red is in effect if the T-SD-02 Control has been activated (Indicated by the red switch being turned), if the warhead is charging, or if the ECFR temperature has surpassed 80,000 Kelvin. **You are to immediately drop whatever you are doing and go deal with the present scenario. You are required to try to stop malicious events.**

### Code Black
Code Black indicates there is an active threat that cannot be stopped. Code black is active if the FFD or warhead is activated, or if the ECFR Shutdown window is active. Your priority at this point should be protecting data (for FFD/warhead). If that’s not possible, your priority is to shut down the FFD’s servers, prevent raiders from escaping with the truck, or shut down the ECFR. **You should not be doing anything outside of these objectives unless they are no longer available.**
